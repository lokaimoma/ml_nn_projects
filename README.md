Neural Playground: Adventures in Deep Learning/Machine Learning
---
Hi everyone!

This repository serves as my playground for exploring and learning through hands-on projects. Here, you'll find various experiments focusing on deep neural networks and machine learning in general, covering concepts like Convolutional Neural Networks, Neural network architecture implementations, object detection, etc.

As I embark on this learning journey, my goal is to develop a deep knowledge into how neural networks work, read and understand ML/A.I papers and how to implement them and also get full grasp and experience on the tools used in the field of A.I. I believe in the power of collaboration, so feel free to contribute, discuss, and share your insights on any project!

The projects primarily utilize Tensorflow for anything neural networks related.
