Neural Playground: Adventures in Deep Learning/Machine Learning
---
Hi everyone!

This repository serves as my playground for exploring and learning through hands-on projects. Here, you'll find various experiments focusing on deep neural networks and machine learning in general, covering concepts like Convolutional Neural Networks, Neural network architecture implementations, object detection, etc.

As I embark on this learning journey, my goal is to develop a deep knowledge into how neural networks work, read and understand ML/AI papers and be able to implement them if necessary and also, get a full grasp and experience on the tools used in the field of AI. I believe in the power of collaboration, so feel free to contribute, discuss, and share your insights on any project!

The projects primarily utilize Tensorflow for anything deep learning related, and scikit-learn for anything **"traditional"** machine learning related.
